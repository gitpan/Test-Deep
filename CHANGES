Got rid of struct mode for num()

Large internal changes, now using a stack object rather than just an array.
This handles rendering the stack.

The comparisons handle rendering the got and expected values now.

num() and str() numify/stringify before comparing, this makes overload of ==
or eq irrelevant. This also prevents problems with the diag when something
stringifies differently to it's numificiation or differently each time you
look.

fixed diag of overloaded refs to display the ref value, not the overloaded
value

nicer diags for booleans

Slight doc fix

Added coderef calling as a test

0.07

Fixed number.t to skip strict test when if Scalar::Util is not right

Major improvement of docs. No longer reads like it was written by a drunken
badger.

0.06

Overhaul of Test::Deep::descend, native types are now wrapped up in a
Test::Deep:Cmp object, moves lots of logic out of descend

Added ArrayLength, HashKeys, RefType, and Blessed comparisons

All tests now use Test::NoWarnings

Broke out descend tests into hash.t, array, regexpref.t, probably should
break out more

Updated version of Scalar::Util dependency, thanks to Steve Purkis

0.05

No longer using overload::StrVal() for looking behind overloads as it's
broken for Regexp refs in some versions of Perl.
